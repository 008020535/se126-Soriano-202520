#Lab #4 : Parallel List Processing & Creating/Writing to Files
#January 28,2025 
#_______________________________________________________________________
#Project Description: This is a two-part program where you will work on creating and populating parallel lists based on file data, then create and write data to a file

#create empty lists to hold the file data.

#Counter for employees in each department
