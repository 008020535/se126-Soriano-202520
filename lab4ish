02/03/2025
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Pogram Promt: This is a two part program where you will work on creating and populating parallel lists based on file data, then create and write data to a file 

#Create empty lists to hold the file data.
fulName = []
LastName = []
age = []
userName = []
residence = []

#lists for Processing data
email = []
department = []
phoneLine = []

#Used to ensure no duplicate phone extentensions
tempExt = 0


#Counter for employees in each department
depCount = [0,0,0,0,0,0,]


#Openinig my csv file
with open('got_emails.csv') as csvfile:
  #read csv file, save result into csvfile:
  import csv
  file = csv.reader(csvfile)


#Go through each record in the csv file
for rec in file:


  #Go through each record in the csv file
  for rec in file:


    #Go trhough each field in the record 
    for i in range(0, len(rec)):

  #Match date to parellel lists using the field's index, append to proper list accordingly 
elif house[i] == "House Baratheon":
  deparment.append("sales)
  tempExt = 500
  depCount[4] +=1


  elif house[i} == "the Night's Watch":
    deparment.append("auditing")
    tempExt = 600
    depCount[5] +=1

  #ensure no duplicate ext's
  while tempExt in phoneExt:
    tempExt += 1


  #Append new extension to list
  phoneExt.append(tempExt)
  #Reset temp variable
  tempExt = 0


  #Print with given format 
  print(f"{fulName[i]:20} {lastName[i]:19} {email[i]:17} {deparment[i]:26} {phoneExt[i]:30}")


#Open csv file to write data to
with open ('westeros.csv','w') as csvfile:
  #Open with csv writer instead of reader
  csvwrite = csv.writer(csvfile)


  #ilerate through length of parallel lists
  for i in range(0, len(fulName)):
    #write data to open csv file as a list
    row = [fulName[i], lastName[i], email[i], deparment[i], phoneExt[i]]
    csvwrite.writerow(row)


  #Present to user that csv file saved
  print("\nwesteros.csv saved")


  #Print summary of employee distribution accross deparments
